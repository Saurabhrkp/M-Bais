# Controllers

***Controller:***

Controller controls the requests of the user and then generates appropriate response which is fed to the viewer. Typically, the user interacts with the View, which in turn generates the appropriate request, this request will be handled by a controller. The controller renders the appropriate view with the model data as a response.

[***Using template engines with Express***](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html)

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page.

Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS. The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it also supports several others.

[*res.render(view [, locals] [, callback])*](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.render)

Renders a view and sends the rendered HTML string to the client. Optional parameters:

- locals, an object whose properties define local variables for the view.
- callback, a callback function. If provided, the method returns both the possible error and rendered string, but does not perform an automated response. When an error occurs, the method invokes next(err) internally.

The view argument is a string that is the file path of the view file to render. This can be an absolute path, or a path relative to the views setting. If the path does not contain a file extension, then the view engine setting determines the file extension. If the path does contain a file extension, then Express will load the module for the specified template engine (via require()) and render it using the loaded moduleâ€™s __express function.

[***express-validator***](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/index.html)

An express.js middleware for validator. express-validator is a set of express.js middlewares that wraps validator.js validator and sanitizer functions.

[*Sanitization*](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/sanitization.html)

Sometimes, receiving input in a HTTP request isn't only about making sure that the data is in the right format, but also that it is free of noise.

validator.js provides a handful of sanitizers that can be used to take care of the data that comes in.

[***Async***](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/)

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for use with Node.js and installable via npm i async, it can also be used directly in the browser.

- [*parallel(tasks, callbackopt)*](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#parallel)

  ```import parallel from 'async/parallel';```

  Run the tasks collection of functions in parallel, without waiting until the previous function has completed. If any of the functions pass an error to its callback, the main callback is immediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed, the results are passed to the final callback as an array.

- [*each(coll, iteratee, callbackopt)*](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3/docs.html#each)

  ```import each from 'async/each';```

  Applies the function iteratee to each item in coll, in parallel. The iteratee is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it has finished. If the iteratee passes an error to its callback, the main callback (for the each function) is immediately called with the error.

# [***userController.js***](https://github.com/Saurabhrkp/M-Bias/blob/master/controllers/userController.js)


- This function when called for route, [renders](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.render) ```signup.ejs``` as signup.

  ```js
  exports.get_signup = (req, res) => {
    res.render('signup');
  };
  ```

- This is middleware that validates the sign up request sent from user. [*Sanitizes all fields*](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/sanitization.html). And Custom validators/sanitizers
Although express-validator offers plenty of handy validators and sanitizers through its underlying dependency validator.js, it doesn't always suffice when building your application.

  For these cases, you may consider writing a custom validator or a custom sanitizer.

  [***Custom validator***](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/custom-validators-sanitizers.html)

  A custom validator may be implemented by using the chain method .custom(). It takes a validator function.

  Custom validators may return Promises to indicate an async validation (which will be awaited upon), or throw any value/reject a promise to use a custom error message.

  ```js
  await body('name')
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 1 })
    .withMessage(`Name field can't be empty`)
    .run(req);
  await body('username')
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 6, max: 16 })
    .withMessage('Username has to be longer than 6.')
    .isAlphanumeric()
    .withMessage('Username has non-alphanumeric characters.')
    .custom(async (value) => {
      const user = await User.findOne({ username: value });
      if (user) {
        throw new Error('Username already in use');
      }
      return true;
    })
    .run(req);
  ```

  Here custom validator is used to check Username has been already taken by anyone.

  [*validationResult()*](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/validation-result-api.html)

  These methods are all available via require('express-validator').

  validationResult(req)
  req: the express request object
  `Returns: a Result object`

  Extracts the validation errors from a request and makes them available in a Result object.

  [*.array([options])*](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/validation-result-api.html#arrayoptions)

  options (optional): an object of options. Defaults to { onlyFirstError: false }
  `Returns: an array of validation errors.`

  Gets all validation errors contained in this result object.

  If the option onlyFirstError is set to true, then only the first error for each field will be included.

  ```js
  const errors = validationResult(req).array();
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    const error = errors.map((error) => error.msg)[0];
    const { name, email, username, password, passwordConfirmation } = req.body;
    return res.render('signup', {
      error,
      name,
      username,
      email,
      password,
      passwordConfirmation,
  });
  ```

  If validation fails on any field the errors are passed as an array and re-renders sign-up page with error or else pass the req, res to next middleware.

- After validation if no error are found, new user is created with Mongoose User Model imported with values, and using [***bcrypt library***](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) hashed password is generated and replaced in user model, then finally save the user in mongodb and redirect new user to login page.

  ```js
  exports.signup = async (req, res, next) => {
    const { name, email, password, username } = req.body;
    const user = await new User({ name, email, username, password });
    let salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    let hash = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt);
    user.password = hash;
    await user.save();
    req.flash('success_msg', 'You are now registered and can log in');
    res.redirect('/api/signin');
  };
  ```

- This function when called for route, [renders](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.render) ```signin.ejs``` as signin.

  ```js
  exports.get_signin = (req, res) => {
    res.render('signin');
  };
  ```

- Refer [Lib folder](https://github.com/Saurabhrkp/M-Bias/tree/master/lib) for more and See [*Passport*](http://www.passportjs.org/) and [*docs*](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/).

  ```js
  exports.signin = (req, res, next) => {
    passport.authenticate('local', (err, user, info) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.render('signin', { error: err.message });
      }
      if (!user) {
        return res.render('signin', { error: info.message });
      }
      req.logIn(user, (err) => {
        if (err) {
          return res.render('signin', { error: err.message });
        }
        res.redirect('/');
      });
    })(req, res, next);
  };
  ```

- This function destroys sessions, clears cookie and logs out user then redirects to index page. [*Session.destroy(callback)*](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html)
Destroys the session and will unset the req.session property. Once complete, the callback will be invoked.

  ```js
  exports.signout = (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(() => {
      res.clearCookie('connect.sid');
      req.logout();
      res.redirect('/');
    });
  };
  ```

- This middleware check if request made is by an authenticated user. If request made is Authenticated then pass it to next middleware else redirects it to signin page with error message.

  ```js
  exports.checkAuth = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
      return next();
    }
    req.flash('error_msg', 'You have to be registered and logged in');
    res.redirect('/api/signin');
  };
  ```

- This middleware fetchs profile of user from database from the username in URL params and also gets all liked post by user. Then pass it to next middleware.

  ```js
  exports.getUserByUsername = async (req, res, next, username) => {
    try {
      req.profile = await User.findOne({ username: username }).populate({
        path: 'saved',
        select: '-photos -body -video -comments -tags -likes ',
      });
      req.profile.liked = await Post.find({
        likes: { $in: [req.profile._id] },
      }).select('-photos -body -video -comments -tags -likes');
      next();
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  };
  ```

- This function when called for route, [renders](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.render) ```profile.ejs``` as profile page with given user profile.

    res.render('profile', { profile: req.profile });
  };
  ```

- This function is for toggling saved post. It added if post dont exist in users profile and remove if previously not added to user profile and then redirects to same post page.

  ```js
  exports.toggleSavedPost = async (req, res, next) => {
    const user = await User.findOne({ _id: req.user.id });
    const savedIds = user.saved.map((id) => id.toString());
    const postId = req.post._id.toString();
    if (savedIds.includes(postId)) {
      await user.saved.pull(postId);
      req.flash('success_msg', `Removed from saved post: ${req.post.title}`);
    } else {
      await user.saved.push(postId);
      req.flash('success_msg', `Added to saved post: ${req.post.title}`);
    }
    await user.save();
    res.redirect(`/${req.post.slug}`);
  };
  ```

- This function is for updating user profile and redirecting to same profile page.

      { new: true, runValidators: true }
    );
    req.flash('success_msg', 'Your Account is updated');
    res.redirect(`/api/${req.user.username}`);
  };
  ```
